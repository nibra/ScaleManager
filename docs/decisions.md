##Decisions

- The logic for moving instances between multiple hostingsystems decides not the manager. This is part of the isac-api
- Duplicating existing instances is possible with the current architecture but will not be implemented yet
- New timebased rules ca be extracted and generated from the collected data. Timebased rules are not managed by the scale manager, this is part of ISAC
